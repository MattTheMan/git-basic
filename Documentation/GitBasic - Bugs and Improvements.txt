IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------------------------------

Sort FileStatus items - especially on staging and unstaging

Figure out diff when file is staged (against index/HEAD)
Disable command line till ready - this doesn't work if you need to ctrl-C
Shorten height of branch menu

Disable ctrl + c for console - Keyboard shortcuts Ctrl c, Ctrl v, and just control in general make copying and pasting with keyboard shortcuts a little nonfunctional, because ctrl + c kills the current process in the command prompt, and is additional input that is unintended.
FileStatus Control Adorner on file drag - Add an adorner to show the file or directory name (or an image) when dragging the file.
Line numbers in diff viewer - This would make the diffs more readable
Keyboard shortcut or button to scroll to top of git command output - For large git log outputs, it can be a bit annoying to get to the top of the log with just the mouse wheel. A keyboard shortcut or button on the right side of the console window, or even a scroll bar might make this easier.
FileStatus Control Add directory and file image - Add a folder and file image in front of the name for each file, like windows explorer.
Unstaged TreeView file differentiation - Right now, both untracked and tracked files are shown in unstaged and they are not differentiated in any way. Proposal: Untracked files shown in a grey color Tracked files shown in white
