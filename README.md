## Feature Overview
Git Basic is easy to use. It’s not bloated with features. In fact, that’s why it’s called Git Basic. Here is a brief overview of the primary features of Git Basic.

### Integrated Terminal

Type Git commands here. This is a cmd.exe terminal control, so you can enter more than just Git commands here.

### Status Bar

Click the repository name (on the left side of the status bar) to reveal a directory selector. You can navigate to a different    repository from here. Click the branch name (on the right side of the status bar) to reveal a list of all local branches in the repository. You can switch branches by selecting one.
 
### Command Buttons

These are command buttons to quickly execute Git commands. When you click one, you will see the output in the terminal. Some execute the command for you. Others just paste the command text in the input box, so that you can complete the command. Hold down the Ctrl key to reveal hotkeys for these buttons.

### File Status Control

The file status control shows you which files are staged or unstaged. If you select an unstaged file from the tree view, you will see its diff in the diff viewer. You can drag and drop files or directories to and from Staged Changes and Unstaged Changes in order to stage or unstage.
